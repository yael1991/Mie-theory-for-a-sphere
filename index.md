# Mie Theory 

### 1. Light scattering and light absorption by a Sphere
Mieâ€™s Theory provides a way to calculate analytically the field scattered and absorbed by spheres of arbitrary radius, *a*, and refractive index, *N*. By expanding the incident electromagnetic wave into spherical harmonics, Gustav Mie was able to solve the Maxwell equations for this kind of geometry taking into account the boundary condition between the sphere and the medium that surrounds it.
The solutions of the absorbed and scattered fields are developed into vector spherical harmonics. Both solutions depend on different coeffients which are called Mie coeffients. On the one hand, there are the scattering coefficients which are usually denoted as *a_n* and *b_n*. On the other hand, there are the coefficients related to the  field inside the sphere, *c_n* and *d_n*. 
 
### 2. What does the **Mie-theory-for-a-sphere** does?
 
**Mie-theory-for-a-sphere** calculates:
- Absorption, Scattering and Extinction cross-sections (*Q_abs*, *Q_sca* and *Q_ext*).
- Electric and magnetic dipolar and quadrupolar contributions to the cross-sections (*a_1* dipolar electric, *b_1* dipolar magnetic, *a_2* quadrupolar electric and *b_2* quadrupolar magnetic).
- Linear polarization degree at rigth angle (*PL(90)*).
